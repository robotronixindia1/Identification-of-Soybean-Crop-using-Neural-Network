# Identification-of-Soybean-Crop-using-Neural-Network
This project focuses on predicting and detecting infections in soybean plants using AI for better crop management. By deploying machine learning models like CNNs and EfficientDet B0, the system enables early disease detection through image analysis. TensorFlow supports model training and optimization for high accuracy. Real-time monitoring in controlled environments ensures continuous crop health assessment. Automated pod counting aids in precise yield estimation, enhancing decision-making for farmers. The solution promotes timely interventions, minimizing crop losses and improving productivity. It integrates AI-driven tools to modernize agricultural practices. Overall, the project boosts sustainable farming through smarter, more efficient disease and yield monitoring.![Screenshot 2025-02-06 142238](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d324ae-34a9-47fc-aed1-ca0fba2203b0)
